This is a Flask web application that provides a news aggregator service. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Database

The application uses a SQLite database to store user data, articles, and other information. The database is initialized using the init_db function, which creates two tables: users and articles.

Routes

The application has several routes:

/: The homepage, which displays top headlines from the News API.
/admin_login: The admin login page, which authenticates the admin user.
/admin_dashboard: The admin dashboard, which is currently empty.
/signup: The user signup page, which allows users to create an account.
/login: The user login page, which authenticates users.
/logout: The logout page, which clears the user's session.
/SwehulYoutube: A page that renders a YouTube video.
/article/<int:article_id>: A page that displays a specific article.
/articles: A page that allows users to submit or edit articles.
/user_articles: A page that displays a user's submitted articles.
/PersonalisedGenresSelection: A page that allows users to select their preferred genres.
/delete_file/<int:article_id>/<path:file_name>: A page that deletes a file associated with an article.
/edit_article/<int:article_id>: A page that allows users to edit an article.
Functions

The application has several functions:

get_db: Returns a connection to the SQLite database.
close_db: Closes the database connection.
is_logged_in: Checks if a user is logged in.
get_top_headlines: Fetches top headlines from the News API.
save_user_to_database: Saves a user's data to the database.
save_article_to_database: Saves an article to the database.
update_article_in_database: Updates an article in the database.
fetch_articles_from_database: Fetches articles from the database.
is_admin: Checks if a user is an admin.
is_author: Checks if a user is the author of an article.
delete_file: Deletes a file associated with an article.
edit_article: Edits an article.
save_data_to_files: Saves data to a SQLite database and a JSON file.
init_db_and_files: Initializes the database and JSON file.
fetch_articles_from_json: Fetches articles from a JSON file.
JSON File

The application uses a JSON file to store article data. The save_data_to_files function saves data to both the SQLite database and the JSON file. The fetch_articles_from_json function fetches articles from the JSON file.

Initialization

The application is initialized using the init_db_and_files function, which creates the database and JSON file. The app.run function starts the Flask development server.
